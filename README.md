# Zyro as a frontend for machine learning project - face finder 

Tutorial how to use [Zyro web site builder](https://zyro.com/) as a frontend for machine learning project. It is related to my [first project](https://github.com/tomasrasymas/zyro-as-ml-frontend-sentiment/)

I am going to create a face finder service, deploy it as a Restful API on Google Cloud Platform as Cloud Function and then use the Zyro website builder to make my model accessible to the whole world.

Final result achieved [face finder](https://facefinder.zyrosite.com/).
